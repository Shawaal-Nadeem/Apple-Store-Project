        <h1 className="about-heading1">iPhone Generations to Come</h1>
        <p>Apple has released a total of 34 iPhones over the years (38 if they release the four new iPhone 14 models). We've given you a complete look at each iPhone evolution, starting when Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone in 2007. As you can see, the iPhone has gone through a lot of changes, from a 16 GB web browser to a 1 TB all-in-one camera, workspace, and entertainment center.In the early days, Apple released one iPhone per year. That gradually changed as the releases of new models got closer and closer together from 2010 to 2013. With the September rollout, though, Apple released both the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c, ushering in an era of two iPhone releases per year. 2017, 2018, and 2019 each saw the release of three more iPhone models, and then in 2020 the tech giant shocked the world. Not only did it release the iPhone SE (second-generation) in April, the company also rolled out the four iPhones in the 12-series lineup in its delayed fall announcement. At its September 2021 event, Apple revealed the four new phones that comprise the iPhone 13 lineup, the latest phones available from Apple until the release of the iPhone SE (third-generation) in March 2022. We'll see if Apple unveils the iPhone 14 in September 2022!</p>
      <h1 className="about-heading1">Why Did Apple Skip Some iPhone Numbers?</h1>
      <p>Did you know that there isn't an iPhone 2? After Apple created the first generation iPhone, the one that came after that was all about 3G internet connectivity, so the iPhone 2 was skipped. Why did Apple skip iPhone 9? Well, there wasn't an iPhone 9 because Apple went straight to the iPhone X, a decision made based on it being released in the tenth year after the very first iPhone release. Apple is known for doing things its own way, so frankly we're not surprised.We loved learning about the history of the iPhone over the years, and we hope you did too! Be sure to check back in and stay up-to-date with all the newest models as the iPhone continues to evolve and grow.

      <h1 className="about-heading1">The Evolution of the iPhone Camera</h1>
      <p>Did the first iPhone have a camera? It sure did, though not an especially powerful or clear one. Still, it was better than a disposable camera! The first iPhone also gave users access to just 16 GB of storage at most, and 4 GB on the low end. Can you imagine? 

The cameras built into iPhones have always been a major draw for the devices, and Apple has shown a company initiative to continue improving upon iPhone cameras with each release. These days, you can enjoy incredible detail and professional-level finishing just with the stock camera and photo editing options included with your iPhone! We hope this article answers any questions you have about the evolution of phones in Apple's lineup. This iPhone evolution chart will continue to grow over the years, and we'll be here to keep it updated: from the upcoming iPhone 14 to a hypothetical iPhone 15 and beyond. Maybe in 2027 we'll even get an iPhone XX! What do you think is coming in the Apple cell phone timeline? Let us know your thoughts and guesses below.</p>

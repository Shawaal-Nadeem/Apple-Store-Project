    <p className='detailPhone'>Instead of the iPhone mini, Apple brought the Plus back for iPhone 14, with the slightly larger display that had been restricted to the exclusive Pro and Pro Max models in recent years. The iPhone 14 models came with some impressive safety-focused features, including Crash Detection (which automatically detects a car wreck and contacts emergency services in the event of a crash) and Emergency SOS via satellite, a feature with the capability to connect to emergency services via satellite if you find yourself in distress while out of range of Wi-Fi or cellular. The Emergency SOS via satellite is a first in the smartphone arena, since connecting to a satellite was previously only possible through bulky expensive devices built specifically for this purpose. The iPhone 14 & 14 Plus also offers a new dual-camera system, designed to take low-light photography to the next level (goodbye, grainy nighttime photos!). </p>

    <p className='detailPhone'>Similar to the iPhone 14 base model, the 6.1" iPhone 14 Pro debuted with the same Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite safety features. In addition to the new A16 Bionic chip, it also got a surprising upgrade, with a new "Dynamic Island" feature where the notch used to be. While the notch isn't gone, it now adapts to whatever you are doing to more seamlessly display notifications and background activities. It also featured an Always-On display, made possible by low-energy components, so that the time and widgets on your lock screen are always viewable. In perhaps the most impressive update, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max offer a 48 MP camera (a sharp jump from the 12 MP camera offered by the previous model). This translates to a more flexible camera, with more options for framing and cropping, as well as better low-light shots so you can worry less about the lighting and more about capturing the moment.</p>

    <p className='detailPhone'>Apple introduced the 32 GB storage option with the iPhone 3GS, doubling it from the first iPhone. Clearly, introducing the App Store changed things quickly.

Apple also added Voice Control, although weâ€™d have to wait a couple more years before the introduction of Siri.</p>
